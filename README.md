# Experiments

This repository organizes code, notes, and data about experiments I've
conducted, mostly focused on audio search and synthesis.

## Currently Interesting
- [Unsupervised Learning of Semantic Audio Embeddings](unsupervised-semantic-audio-embeddings)
- [Deep Audio Prior](deep-audio-prior)
- [WaveGAN](wave-gan)
- [AutoEncoder Trained with Perceptual Loss Function](raw-sample-autoencoder)
- [Progressively Growing GANs for Audio Generation](growing-gan-audio)

These experiments can be deployed to an EC2 GPU instance and run using the
[scripts found in `/deploy`](deploy).
